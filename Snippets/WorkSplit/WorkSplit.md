# Readme
WorkSplit is used for spliting workload when doing group homework equally.

## How to use?
Complie the `.cpp` file first. If you are using a Mac, simply use the compiled UNIX executable. Input a number of the works, then hit `enter`, you'll get the arranged list of works.
You may need to slightly alter the code to fit the number of member in your group, and their names.

## Licence
Such a simple program..... Just use it as you like.
